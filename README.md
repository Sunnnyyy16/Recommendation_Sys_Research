# Recommendation_Sys_Research


## Study and Implementation of Recommendation System Papers Recorded in Issues
- Questions to ask myself when reading papers 


```
1. What previous research and ideas were cited that this paper is building off of? (this info tends to live in the introduction)
2. Was there reasoning for performing this research, if so what was it? (introduction section)
3. Clearly list out the objectives of the study
4. Was any equipment/software used? (methods section)
5. What variables were measured during experimentation? (methods)
6. Were any statistical tests used? What were their results? (methods/results section)
7. What are the main findings? (results section)
8. How do these results fit into the context of other research and their 'field'? (discussion section)
9. Explain each figure and discuss their significance.
10. Can the results be reproduced and is there any code available?
11. Name the authors, year, and title of the paper!
12. Are any of the authors familiar, do you know their previous work? 
13. What key terms and concepts do I not know and need to look up in a dictionary, textbook, or ask someone?
14. What are your thoughts on the results? Do they seem valid?
